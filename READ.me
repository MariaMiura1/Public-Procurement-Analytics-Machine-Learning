Public Procurement Analytics & Machine Learning
Harmonising TED (EU) and PCSP (Spain)
Overview

This project develops an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning pipeline for public procurement data, combining European-level data (Tenders Electronic Daily – TED/eForms) with national Spanish data from the Plataforma de Contratación del Sector Público (PCSP).

The objective is to transform heterogeneous and complex administrative procurement data into actionable insights, analytical datasets, and decision-support indicators, aligned with both the European procurement framework and the Spanish legal framework (LCSP).

Data Sources

TED (EU) – Contract notices (2018–2023), providing harmonised European procurement data for cross-country analysis.

PCSP (Spain) – Open data from the Ministry of Finance, offering detailed national-level information from contracting authorities’ profiles.

These two sources are analysed jointly to ensure comparability at EU level and depth at national level.

Methodology

Data ingestion, cleaning and type harmonisation (Python, pandas)

Feature engineering aligned with procurement lifecycle concepts (CPV, procedure, buyer, value, dates)

Machine learning models applied to procurement data, including:

Text-based classification (e.g. CPV grouping)

Indicator-based risk and anomaly detection

Creation of analytical “gold” datasets for visualisation and reporting

Outputs

Reproducible analytical datasets combining TED and PCSP

Machine learning predictions and procurement indicators

Data prepared for interactive dashboards (e.g. Power BI)

Purpose

This project demonstrates how data analysis, machine learning and domain knowledge in public procurement can be combined to support evidence-based decision-making for public institutions and policy analysis at both European and national levels.
